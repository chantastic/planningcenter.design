## tl;dr

Use this font scale, based on a rounded Minor Third (1.2).

```
30px
25px
21px
18px
16px (base, option 1)
14px (base, option 2)
12px
10px
```

## Exceptions

There will always be exceptions.  
Hero text could be much larger than 30px.  
We recommend handling exceptions with inline styles: `style="font-size: 56px"`

## Status

**Progressive**: _Design and develop new layouts with this font scale._

We have some apps that are all-in.  
Don't stress.  
Update them where you see them.

## General guidelines

**NOTE**: These are suggestions, not concrete rules&mdash;context, contrast, and color play a vital role in which weight is best for specific scenarios.

### Normal / min
- 400 is recommended for standard body text and the minimum overall used weight.

### Strong / max
- 700 is recommended for strong body text and the maximum overall used weight.

### Additional weights
- 500, 600 may be used on a case-by-case basis, especially in smaller titles where 700 may feel too heavy.

## project philosophy

Project yie is a focus on the modern web.  

3-4% of our current use base uses ie11.  
And supporting them today takes a disproportionate amount of work and library code.  

Project yie is about targeting modern browsers by defining what "ie11 support" means for Planning Center.

## JavaScript

JavaScript should be polyfilled, inline with our [browser support](http://localhost:8000/browser-support).  

In our apps, that can be done easily with [babel-preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env).
